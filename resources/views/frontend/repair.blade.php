            Credit repair businesses are fully managed services that assist consumers in raising their credit score or helping them qualify for credit. Your clients will come to you with bad credit, and your goal is to help them improve it. The specific services that credit repair services offer usually entail disputing inaccurate negative information on your client's credit report. You'll manage the entire process which includes communicating back and forth with credit bureaus, creditors, lenders, and collection agencies on behalf of your client. </p>
