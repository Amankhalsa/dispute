          <p>Before you can begin the credit repair process, you'll need to import a credit report. Our software will walk you through exactly how to get access to your client's credit report, how to import it into DisputeBee, and how to monitor it for changes such as when negative items like collections and inquiries get removed from the report.. </p>
          <p>Once you've imported a credit report, you'll be able to choose which items you'd like to dispute. This could be erroneous collections, accounts, credit inquiries, late payments, and more. DisputeBee will instantly generate letters for you to print out and mail to the credit bureaus. We help you leverage laws like the FCRA which often results in these items being removed from their credit report!. </p>
          <p>
            After you mail your first round of letters to the bureaus, you will wait for a response and then upload it into DisputeBee. It often takes multiple rounds of correspondence with the bureaus to see any items get removed or for any information to be corrected. DisputeBee will continue to generate response letters for you until the dispute is resolved. This often ends with the negative item in question being deleted from the client's credit report.. </p>
