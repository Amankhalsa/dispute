          <p>If you have bad credit, then you're not alone. Even if you have have "good" credit, but you'd like to achieve "excellent" credit, then this guide is for you. Achieving great credit is not just a one-time fix. It involves learning about how credit works, understand which factors affect your credit score, and how to responsibly use credit. </p>
          <p>Living with bad credit in today's world can make life extra difficult. You'll be stuck paying higher interest rates, which can cost you thousands of dollars over time. You'll have trouble buying a house or renting an apartment. Even applying to rent an apartment with poor credit means you might be stuck paying an increased amount of rent or a higher security deposit! Having a low credit score can increase your auto insurance premiums, raise your credit card interest rates, or result in being denied for a mortgage. </p>
          <p>
            Contrary to popular belief, fixing bad credit doesn't mean you need to hire a professional. If you take the time to learn about credit, you can achieve the same results as professional credit repair companies by doing the work yourself. If you do decide that you'd rather hire a professional, it's still useful to be educated about the credit repair process so that you can choose a reputable company that won't take advantage of you. </p>
